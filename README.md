# Splinterstice

Splinterstice is a decentralized web-based IM inspired by KiwiIRC and Revolt, enhanced with personal features for our standard web client, like a 2.5D GUI. It's primarily for niche online groups native to the "miscellaneous hidden services" on Tor and I2P, The core focus is on those - a term coined by the project's coordinator to describe hidden services on Tor and I2P that are non-indexed, non-illicit, and non-commercial. Meaning that they're not your typical "dark web" or "deep web" hidden services; from NSFL memes to eccentric hobbyist sites, from obscure sociopolitical commentary sites to obscure imageboards to sites that are clearly for shitposting. Splinterstice ensures accessibility only through Tor and I2P for non-registered users, a move designed to prevent dilution by mainstream users, curbing echo chambers and ensuring quality exchanges.

ARGs are not counted under the label of "miscellaneous hidden service" in this instance since, due to modern online horror genres likely not being as prevalent on Tor nowadays over its prevalence on the clearnet; given the recent popularity of the “analog horror” and “digital horror” Youtube subgenres. Which is why the sorta people who’d usually go out of their way to make ARGs or weird art projects of that nature would lately rather be more prevalent on the clearnet rather than hosting their ARG on a darknet, like part of how things would often used to be, on darknets.
