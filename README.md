# Splinterstice

Splinterstice is a decentralized web-based IM(instant messenger) designed to promote free speech absolutism and circumvent the pitfalls of centralized control and censorship. It serves as a privacy-focused secure communication channel for the smaller niche online groups of hidden services on Tor and I2P that don't fall under the label of "dark-web"(anything explicitly illicit) or "deep-web"(anything solely for research purposes). Splinterstice ensures quality discourse without interference from mainstream or centralized platforms, providing a haven for authentic and uncensored conversations.
